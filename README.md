# Faux-Dashboard
A dashboard design brought to fruition with the use of React and the help of Material-UI / Chart.js. 
Bitcoin data used to populate some of the charts through an API.
## Introduction
I saw this design in an Adobe XD project and decided to bring it to life with code. I noticed the elements were based on Material-UI elements so I implemented Material-UI and modified the overall layout to match the design project. I decided to use an api to give the charts some real data to work with.
